# SpaceMonkey - Open Source Telemetry Provider.

SpaceMonkey was created to be a telemetry interface for games with no native telemetry support. 

SpaceMonkey mimics the functionality of the Codemasters Dirt 4 custom udp format which allows SpaceMonkey to be used via the UDP protocol by any software that already supports Dirt 4 and Dirt Rally 2.0 custom udp.
SpaceMonkey also optionally writes telemetry to a Memory Mapped File as an alternative to UDP.

SpaceMonkey contains telemetry visualisation and filtering functionality.

SpaceMonkey supports XINPUT, currently mapped to standard gamepad inputs for steering (left stick), accelerator(right trigger), and brake(left trigger). Clutch and axis assignments coming in a future version. Use the XBOX 360 controller emulator to map your direct input devices to an XINPUT gamepad. https://www.x360ce.com/

SpaceMonkey has been tested with Sim Racing Studio (motion, wind, shakers and led), SimCommander 4 (Accuforce v2) and SimFeedback (motion) and should work with any software that supports Dirt 4 Custom UDP.

## Installation

The latest installer for SpaceMonkey is here (v1.0.5)

https://github.com/PHARTGAMES/SpaceMonkey/raw/main/GenericTelemetryProvider/Installer/SpaceMonkeyTP-SetupFiles/SpaceMonkeyTP.msi

Install anywhere to your local drive.


## Main Interface


![Main Interface](https://github.com/PHARTGAMES/SpaceMonkey/blob/main/Documentation/MainInterface.png?raw=true))]

1. Game selection buttons; press one to load the interface for the selected game.
2. Filters Button; press this to load the filters interface.
3. Config selection; Choose or duplicate/rename the main configuration parameters. Configs are stored in the Configs folder. Ideally a config file will be created for each game as they often have different requirements for filtering.
4. Telemetry Ouput; Choose how you want telemetry to be output from SpaceMonkey and configure the UDP out parameters.
5. Packet formatting; Choose the packet format configuration file or specify "Packet Format Destinations"; these are folders that the packet format configuration file is copied to. Packet formats are specified in the PacketFormats folder and conform to the Dirt 4 Custom UDP specification. https://www.scribd.com/document/350826037/UDP-output-setup
6. Filter Config and Hotkey. Extra filter configs can be created by copying a filter config in the Filters folder. The hotkey can be used to pause and resume telemetry globally when the app is not in focus.

All changes to config options are saved as they are changed.

2. In the STAR WARS: Squadrons game folder there is a subfolder named EasyAntiCheat. Run EasyAntiCheat_Setup.exe and choose uninstall.
3. In the SpaceMonkey install folder there is a subfolder name Squadrons. Copy the steam_appid.txt from this folder into the STAR WARS: Squadrons game folder.

### Usage

1. Launch STAR WARS: Squadrons by running the starwarssquadrons.exe located in the game install folder.
2. Go to the main interface of Space Monkey and select a main config for Squadrons.
3. Go to the main interface of Space Monkey and press the STAR WARS: Squadrons button which will load the Squadrons UI.

## IL-2 Sturmovik

### Setup

1. Edit the file data/startup.cfg located within the IL-2 Sturmovik game folder and add the following:

[KEY = motiondevice]

addr = "127.0.0.1"

decimation = 1

enable = true

port = 4321

[END]

Simulation produces 50Hz rate data output (output 50 samples per second) of in-game player body's state: orientation, rotation speed (spin) and acceleration (if game mission has user-controlled body). To reduce UDP messages output rate the above setup section contains an integer setting “decimation”: UDP_output_rate = Data_output_rate / decimation The default setup makes UDP output rate at the simulation's rate and is equal 50Hz.

Some people may find better results with "decimation = 2".

### Usage

1. Go to the main interface of Space Monkey and select a main config for IL-2 Sturmovik.
2. Go to the main interface of Space Monkey and press the IL-2 Sturmovik button.
